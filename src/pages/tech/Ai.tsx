					Ai is the primary driver of my fears for the future. It is contributing to the failings of the education system, greater wealth inequality, the destruction of the natural world, and the stupidity of the human race. In my opinion, the only valid use case is analyzing large quantities of qualitative data, and even then the moral cost is far too great. Recently my opinion about the use of Ai in programming has changed. Originally, I saw a use for learning, and maybe boilerplate. After using AI a little initially, I have seen first hand the cost of use. Nothing is internalized: you learn nothing but reliance on the tool, which is often incorrect, or at least ineffecient.	All in all, from 2025-17-12 onwards, I will never use any generative Ai, no matter how tempting.
